## Syntax summary#### Six reserved words only| `nil` | the undefined object || `true`, `false` | boolean objects || `self` | the receiver of the current message || `super` | the receiver, in the superclass context || `thisContext` | the current invocation on the call stack |#### Reserved syntactic constructs| `"comment"` | comment || `'string'` | string || `#symbol` | unique string || `$a`, Character space | the character a and a space || 12 2r1100 16rC | twelve \(decimal, binary, hexadecimal\) || 3.14 1.2e3 | floating-point numbers || `#(abc 123)` | literal array with the symbol `#abc` and the number 123 || `{foo . 3 + 2}` | dynamic array built from 2 expressions || `#[123 21 255]` | byte array || _exp1_. _exp2_ | expression separator \(period\) || `;` | message cascade \(semicolon\) || var := _expr_ | assignment || `^` _expr_ | return a result from a method \(caret\) || `[ :e | expr ]` | code block with a parameter || `| var1 var2 |` | declaration of two temporary variables |#### Message SendingWhen we send a message to an object, the message_receiver_, the method is selected and executed; the message returns an object. Messages syntax mimics natural languages, with a subject, a verb, and complements. 		| **Java** | **Pharo** || `aColor.setRGB(0.2,0.3,0)` | `aColor r: 0.2 g: 0.3 b: 0 ` || `d.put("1", "Chocolate"); ` | `d at: '1' put: 'Chocolate'` |#### Three Types of Messages: Unary, Binary, and KeywordA **unary** message is one with no arguments.```Array new
>>> anArray``````#(4 2 1) size
>>> 3````new` is an unary message sent to classes \(classes are objects\). A **binary** message takes only one argument and is named by one or more symbol characters from `+`, `-`, `*`, `= `, `<`, `>`, ...```3 + 4
>>> 7 ``````'Hello' , ' World'
>>>'Hello World'```The `+` message is sent to the object 3 with 4 as argument. The string 'Hello'receives the message `,`\(comma\) with `' World'` as the argument.A **keyword** message can take one or morearguments that are inserted in the message name.```'Pharo' allButFirst: 2
>>> 'aro'``````3 to: 10 by: 2
>>> (3 to: 10 by: 2)```The second example sends`to:by:` to 3, with arguments 10 and 2; thisreturns an interval containing 3, 5, 7, and 9.#### Message PrecedenceParentheses `>` unary `>` binary `>` keyword, and finally fromleft to right.```(15 between: 1 and: 2 + 4 * 3) not
>>> false```Messages `+` and `*` are sent first, then `between:and:` is sent, and `not`.The rule suffers no exception: operators are just binary messages with _no notion of mathematical precedence_. 2 + 4 * 3 reads left-to-right and gives 18, not 14!#### Cascade: Sending Muliple Messages to the Same ObjectMultiple messages can be sent to the same receiver with ;.```OrderedCollection new
  add: #abc;
  add: #def;
  add: #ghi.```The message `new` is sent to `OrderedCollection` which returns a new collection to which threeadd: messages are sent. The value of the whole message cascadeis the value of the last message sent \(here, the symbol`#ghi`\). To return the receiver of themessage cascade instead \(i.e. the collection\), make sure to send`yourself` as the last message of the cascade.#### BlocksBlocks are objects containing code that is executed on demand. They are the basis for control structures like conditionals and loops.```2 = 2
  ifTrue: [ Error signal: 'Help' ]``````#('Hello World')
  do: [ :e | Transcript show: e ]```The first example sends the message `ifTrue:` to the boolean `true` \(computed from2 = 2\) with a block as argument. Because the boolean is true,the block is executed and an exception is signaled. The next examplesends the message `do:` to an array. This evaluates the blockonce for each element, passing it via the e parameter. As aresult, `Hello World` is printed.#### Common Constructs: ConditionalsIn Java```if (condition)
	{ action(); }
	else { anotherAction();} ```In Pharo```condition
	ifTrue: [ action ]
	ifFalse: [ anotherAction ]```In Java```while (condition) { action(); 
     anotherAction(); }```In Pharo```[ condition ] whileTrue: [ action. anotherAction ]```#### Common Constructs: Loops/IteratorsIn Java```for(int i=1; i<11; i++){
    System.out.println(i); } ```In Pharo```1 to: 11 do: [ :i | Transcript show: i ; cr ] ```In Java```String [] names ={"A", "B", "C"};
for( String name : names ) { 
     System.out.print( name );  
     System.out.print(","); }  ```In Pharo```| names | 
names := #('A' 'B' 'C').
names do: [ :each | Transcript show: each, ' , ' ]```Collections start at 1. Messages `at: index` gives element at index and `at: index put: value` sets element at index to value.```#(4 2 1) at: 3
>>> 1 ``````#(4 2 1) at: 3 put: 6
>>>#(4 2 6) ``````Set new add: 4; add: 4; yourself
>>> aSet ```#### Files and Streams```work := FileSystem disk workingDirectory. 
stream := (work / 'foo.txt') writeStream. 
stream nextPutAll: 'Hello World'. 
stream close. 
stream := (work / 'foo.txt') readStream. 
stream contents. 
>>> 'Hello World' 
stream close.```
